# Scrape Books Website

This project is about automating the scraping process of a book site by taking advantage of an powerful tool called Scrapy. It is a framework for extracting data, and writing the data to a file and a number of other useful features made easy.

The project will use Spiders, which according to https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html, "... are classes which define how a certain site (or a group of sites) will be scraped, including how to perform the crawl (i.e. follow links) and how to extract structured data from their pages (i.e. scraping items)."
